# MkDocs Manager
**by sonhuytran@gmail.com**

This is a UI Kit for Mkdocs.
In fact, it just helps you:

- manage your documentation folder
- configure your documentation by an editor for the yaml config file
- launch the MkDocs web server at localhost

It DOESN'T help you create the documentation or edit the markdown files.
